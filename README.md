## Descripton
## Kele
Build Kele, a Ruby Gem API client to access the Bloc API.

## Initialize and Authorize Kele
As a user, I want to initialize and authorize Kele with a Bloc username and password

### Creating the Kele Gem
Create an empty repository on GitHub named Kele and clone it locally.

Creating this project as a RubyGem allows us to integrate Kele with other software.

At a minimum, a RubyGem needs a .gemspec file (typically project_name.gemspec) and one Ruby file (typically lib/project_name.rb).

A gemspec defines metadata about your RubyGem like its name, version, and author.

Create kele.gemspec:
```
 Gem::Specification.new do |s|
   s.name          = 'kele'
   s.version       = '0.0.1'
   s.date          = '2015-12-02'
   s.summary       = 'Kele API Client'
   s.description   = 'A client for the Bloc API'
   s.authors       = ['Hannah McExample']
   s.email         = 'hannah@example.com'
   s.files         = ['lib/kele.rb']
   s.require_paths = ["lib"]
   s.homepage      =
     'http://rubygems.org/gems/kele'
   s.license       = 'MIT'
   s.add_runtime_dependency 'httparty', '~> 0.13'
 end
 ```
Replace date, authors, and email with your own information.

files is an array of files included in the gem. List them individually as you create them:

s.files = ['lib/kele.rb', 'lib/roadmap.rb']`

### Create kele.rb:
```
$ md lib
$ touch lib/kele.rb
```
We place the code for a gem within the lib directory. Gem conventions are to have one Ruby file with the same name as the gem (in this case kele.rb), which gets loaded when we call require './lib/kele'.

Initialization
With the skeleton of Kele created, add an initialize method that creates a new Kele client authorized with a username and password. The client can be used as follows:
```
$ irb
>> require './lib/kele'
=> true
>> Kele.new("jane@gmail.com", "abc123")
```
In initialize, populate two instance variables:

Bloc's base API URL: https://www.bloc.io/api/v1
The user's authentication token, which can be retrieved from the sessions endpoint.
To retrieve the authentication token include HTTParty in Kele, use self.class.post, and pass in the sessions URL along with username and password. See the HTTParty repository for examples.

### Test Your Code
Test initializing Kele in IRB to ensure that:

1.  You retrieve and store the authentication token when passing valid credentials
1.  An appropriate error is raised when passing invalid credentials

## Retrieve Users
As a user, I want to retrieve the current user as a JSON blob

### Retrieving the Current User
Retrieve the current user from the Bloc API by defining get_me which can be used as follows:
```
$ irb
>> require './lib/kele'
=> true
>> kele_client = Kele.new("jane@gmail.com", "abc123")
>> kele_client.get_me
```
Pass auth_token to the request to properly authenticate against the Bloc API. Pass the auth_token via HTTParty's headers option:

response = self.class.get(url, headers: { "authorization" => @auth_token })
HTTParty requests return a response object with the data accessible via the #body method. This information is a JSON String. Add the json gem as a runtime dependency and use the #parse method to convert the user data to a Ruby hash.

### Test Your Code
Test Kele in IRB to ensure that:
1.  You retrieve your own user data
1.  You convert your user data to a Ruby hash

## Mentor Availability
As a user, I want to retrieve a list of my mentor's availability

### Body
Retrieve a list of a mentor's available time slots for the current user from the Bloc API by defining get_mentor_availability which can be used as follows:

```
$ irb
>> require './lib/kele'
=> true
>> kele_client = Kele.new("jane@gmail.com", "abc123")
>> mentor_id = 99
>> kele_client.get_mentor_availability(mentor_id)
```
You will need to include the mentor id in the URL. Find your mentor's id in the user data returned by get_me. Pass auth_token to the request to properly authenticate against the Bloc API.

Convert the JSON response to a Ruby array.

### Test Your Code
Test Kele in IRB to ensure that:

1. You retrieve a list of your mentor's available time slots
1. You convert your mentor's available time slots data to a Ruby array

## Roadmaps and Checkpoints
As a user, I want to retrieve roadmaps and checkpoints.

### Retrieving Roadmaps
Retrieve roadmaps with their associated sections and checkpoints by defining  get_roadmap to be used as follows:

```
$ irb
>> require './lib/kele'
=> true
>> kele_client = Kele.new("jane@gmail.com", "abc123")
>> roadmap_id = 99
>> kele_client.get_roadmap(roadmap_id)
```
Your roadmap id is included in the object returned from calling the get_me method defined in the "Retrieve Users" checkpoint of this project.

Convert the JSON response to Ruby.

### Retrieving Checkpoints
Retrieve checkpoints with their associated body and assignment by defining  get_checkpoint to be used as follows:
```
$ irb
>> require './lib/kele'
=> true
>> kele_client = Kele.new("jane@gmail.com", "abc123")
>> checkpoint_id = 99
>> kele_client.get_checkpoint(checkpoint_id)
```
### Retrieve checkpoint ids from the get_roadmap response.

### Refactor Roadmaps and Checkpoints
lib/kele.rb is starting to get cluttered. Clean it up by moving get_roadmap and  get_checkpoint into a separate lib/roadmap module. require the file in lib/kele.rb and include the module.

### Test Your Code
Test Kele in IRB to ensure that you can:

1. Retrieve a roadmap and its associated sections and checkpoints
1. Retrieve a checkpoint and its associated body and assignment
1. Continue to use get_roadmap and get_checkpoint after moving them into a module

## Messaging
As a user, I want to retrieve a list of my messages, respond to an existing message, and create a new message thread

### Retrieving Messages
On the Bloc platform all messages belong to a message thread. Retrieve all message threads for the current user by defining get_messages. The all message threads endpoint returns message threads paginated with 10 threads per page and a total count of all threads. Either return the first page of messages or a specified page.
```
$ irb
>> require './lib/kele'
=> true
>> kele_client = Kele.new("Hannah.McExample@gmail.com", "abc123")
>> kele_client.get_messages(1) # returns the first page of message threads
>> kele_client.get_messages # returns all message threads
```
Convert the JSON responses to native Ruby objects.

### Creating Messages
Add a create_message method that creates a new message on the Bloc platform. Use the create message endpoint to create a new message and thread.

### Test Your Code
Test Kele in IRB to ensure that you can:

1. Retrieve all messages for the current user
1. Create a new message and thread
